CystiAgents: an agent-based model to simulate Taenia Solium local-scale transmission.
This distribution contains:

1)	The CystiAgents source codes
2)	Aggregated de-identified data to run test simulations
3)	Files to compile and run the simulations
4)  Source files and file to compile and run the extensions program to run the  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to calibrate the model

To compile CystiAgents use the compile.sh script. The package is known to compile with Java jdk version 1.8.0_131.
To run the simulations, edit files in params/ and then use the compile_andRun.sh script.

The ABC code is in the directory extensions. Use the parameters files change the ABC configuration. Use the compile.sh script to compile and the compile_andRun.sh script to run the ABC alghritm.
